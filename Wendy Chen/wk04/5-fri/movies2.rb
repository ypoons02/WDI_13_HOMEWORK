#Movies_2

#A more advanced version of the Movies Sinatra App
#Summary
#The students will update their movies app to allow users to search the database of movies.

#Specification
#Instead of returning a single title, the OMDb API allows you t do a search which will return multiple titles.

#For example if you search on Jaws, you will get a list like the following:
#Jaws
#Jaws 2
#Jaws 3-D
#Jaws Special
#Jaws Wired Shut
#Update your app to allow users to enter a search for movies, and to show the list as a set of links. Users should then be able to click on the link and go to the movie-etails page (like in your existing app).

#Extra credit:
#Consider updating the search functionality so that if you just get one movie back - you don't show the list but take the user straight to the page that shows the information (fewer clicks makes for better user experience).

#Extra extra credit:
#Everytime a user does a search save the movie searched into a file called search_history.txt
#add an extra path '/history' that list out all search history
