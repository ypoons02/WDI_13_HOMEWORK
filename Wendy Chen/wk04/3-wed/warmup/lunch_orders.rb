#Lunch Orders

#It's approaching lunch hourâ€¦ let's collect orders.
#Create a new file called lunch_orders.rb to complete this exercise.

#Create a program that collects lunch orders. Prompt:
#Name for order: (enter name)
#{name} wants to order: (enter item)

#Store the name/order data. When storing data, do it in such a way that
#additional order items may be added for the person's name.
#Example: Greg can order a Burger, and then add Fries to his order later.

#After storing data, prompt the user with:
#Add another item to the order? (y/n)

#Repeat steps 1 & 2 if the answer is "y"

#After the user completes adding orders, print out:
#"All orders: {order data}"
#Keep going...

#Rather than printing out a blob of raw lunch order data, print each name's orders
#on a separate line, formatted as one of the following:

#"Greg ordered a sandwich"
#"Peter ordered a burger & fries"
#"Travis ordered a salad, apple & water"
#You may have to do some hunting in Ruby docs!
