Redux is a predictable state container for javaScript apps.
(If you're looking for a WordPress framework, check out [Redux Framework](http://www.google.com/) .)

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](http://www.goog.e.com).

Yu can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library.
It is tiny(2kb, including dependencies).

#### Developer experience
I wrote Redux while working on my React Europe talk called ["Hot Reloading with Time Travel"](http://www.google.com). my goals was to create a state management library with minimal API but completely predictable behavior, so it is possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and reply, without any buy-in from the developer.
